## Overview
This project develops a TensorFlow-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin lesions as either malignant or benign. By leveraging a robust dataset and advanced neural network architectures, we aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy for skin cancer.

## Features
- **Data Management**: Functions for loading and segmenting data into train, validation, and test sets.
- **TensorFlow Dataset**: Custom class for managing image data within TensorFlow.
- **Enhanced Data Augmentation**: Applies advanced techniques to improve model generalization.
- **CNN Model Structure**: A detailed CNN architecture featuring multiple convolutional and dense layers.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Provides mechanisms for efficient model training and accuracy assessment on validation datasets.

## Usage
To operate this project:
1. Download the repository.
2. Insert your dataset into the designated folder.
3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook to proceed with model training.

## Model Training
The training routine involves loading the dataset, applying data augmentation to enhance the dataset's diversity, and conducting training iterations over multiple epochs. The model's efficacy is systematically evaluated after each epoch to ensure optimal learning and performance adjustments.
